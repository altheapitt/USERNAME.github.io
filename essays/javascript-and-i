Ever since I first grasped a paintbrush, I’ve always been eager to learn about design. 
Design is such a complex concept. For example, when looking at abstract art, its meaning 
can be completely different for different people. It motivates a person to think thoughtfully 
and has the potential to submerge them in a sea of imagination. It’s that special 
relationship between the viewer and the art that makes something as technical as software 
engineering interesting to me.
