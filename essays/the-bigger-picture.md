  My main drive to major in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa was learning how
  to do website development.  my lWithittle and new experience of doing so, I am still living for it.
  
## What am I thinking? 
  
  Despite my joy doing web development, there are some aspects of the subject I do not enjoy. One being, Semantic UI.
  I love just coding using raw HTML and CSS, to me, Semantic UI takes the fun out of it.
  
  ... but, there are many benefits to uding UI frameworks such as Semantic UI. (1) They are very easy to get rolling,
  (2) it's just really nice to look at, (3) code is reliable and tested and (4) help is very easy to get when using
  UI frameworks.
  
  Just the thought of code being too easy freaks me out, that's why I prefer coding raw HTML and CSS.
