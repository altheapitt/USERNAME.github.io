  My main drive to major in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa was learning how
  to do website development.  Little did I know how important understanding the bigger picture of design frameworks
  would be, especially when dealing with my future in website development.
  
## What am I thinking? 
  
  My favorite front-end framework has to be Semantic-UI. The amount of resources in its extensive library is just amazing.
  Using semantic is easy as well, because of how integrated it is and clean looking it makes your code look, it is very
  easy to understand and program without reference. A lot of it is self-explanatory, makes sense, and bottom-line,
  works.
  
  As for right now, I would say that learning another front-end framework sounds like a lot of work. I would be impressed
  if I find something better than Semantic UI.
