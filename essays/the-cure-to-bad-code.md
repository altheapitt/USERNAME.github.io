My first impressions of ESLint with IntelliJ? Wow, great, now I can really focus on my coding format, but once I started to actually program with IntelliJ, I found that I got frustrated with how difficult it was trying to get that green checkmark. Despite this, it's not all for nothing.
  
## "...Programming Sucks" - Programmer
   
ESLint is an open source JavaScript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesnâ€™t adhere to certain style guidelines. There are code linters for most programming languages, and compilers sometimes incorporate linting into the compilation process.

So what do I do when I get an error? I google and google away until I find what is wrong with my code. I get it, this can be tedious but, at least we won't be missing any semicolons anymore. And with the way ESLint sets the formatting, the end result is a very beautiful layout...

With automatic indentation and errors that make sense, ESLint is very helpful for someone at my stage of programming.

## Repetition, rep-zZzz.

Just like Bart here, the only way to write better code is to write code. It may not be 'good code' but with ESLint you'll achieve something a little better than 'bad code'... to their standards... if you meet that green checkmark. Good luck!
