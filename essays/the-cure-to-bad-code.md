My first impressions of ESLint with IntelliJ? Wow, great, now I can really focus on my coding format, but once I started to actually program with IntelliJ, I found that I got frustrated with how difficult it was trying to get that green checkmark. Despite this, it's not all for nothing.
  
## "...Programming Sucks" - Programmer
   
ESLint is an open source JavaScript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines. There are code linters for most programming languages, and compilers sometimes incorporate linting into the compilation process.

So what do I do when I get an error? I google and google away until I find what is wrong with my code. I get it, this can be tedious but, at least we won't be missing any semicolons anymore. And with the way ESLint sets the formatting, the end result is a very beautiful layout...

With automatic indentation and errors that make sense, ESLint is very helpful for someone at my stage of programming.

Just like Bart here, the only way to write better code is to write code. It may not be 'good code' but with ESLint you'll achieve something a little better than 'bad code'... to their standards... if you meet that green checkmark. Good luck!
