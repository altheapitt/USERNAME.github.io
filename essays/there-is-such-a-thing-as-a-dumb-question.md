Everyone who has been on a computer programming forum website knows how rough other users can be with their replies and comments but, they do so with good reason and a lot of these nasty replies can be prevented with a better understanding on how to ask for help.

## "...Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers" - Stack Overflow
   
Stack Overflow is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network,[4][5][6] created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. The way it works is Stack Overflow serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Digg.
