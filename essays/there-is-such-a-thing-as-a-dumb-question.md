Everyone who has been on a computer programming forum website knows how rough users can be with their replies and comments but, they do so with good reason... A lot of these nasty replies can be prevented with a better understanding on how to ask for help. Question is, HOW DO YOU ask for help?
  
## "...Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers"
   
Stack Overflow is a privately held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. The way it works is Stack Overflow serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Digg.

## The Not so Good, Bad, & Ugly

To the left is an example of a poorly worded and scary looking wall of text. Somewhere in that paragraph is a fellow programmer asking for help, too bad no one can figure out what they want. Can you spot the question this user is asking?

...and with a poorly worded help threat, comes a comment that could have been an answer with more given information.
