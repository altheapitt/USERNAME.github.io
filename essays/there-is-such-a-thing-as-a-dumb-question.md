  Prior to my second semester of my junior year at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, I had no experience programming with JavaScript - it had also been two years since I programmed in Java. With C and C++ being my most recent focus, JavaScript was a little rough for me to adjust to...
  
## What am I thinking? 
  
  My opinion on JavaScript is very neutral, with my average time programming, I feel I have a lot more to learn about all the other languages aside from JavaScript before forming an opinion. Although, I can say that I do enjoy programming with JavaScript, it is different, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Everything still makes sense to me which is all I need when learning a new language.
  
  I am excited to learn JavaScript well as software programming is my major focus in my Information and Computer Sciences pathway. I see potential in myself programming using JavaScript and it has only made me more and more excited to learn the language with a level proficient enough to feel better about putting JavaScript as a skill on my résumé.
