“Olympic Runner” is a game I created in the ICS introduction class at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, this was my partner and I's final project in this class. Our task was to create a game that used a number of different functions that were taught throughout the course of the class. We came up with a version of "Simon Says" that got my professor laughing. The goal of the game is the same as the original, garner as many points as you can!

## Who is that man?

The man giving commands is none other than my ICS introduction level professor, Jason Leigh, the director of the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa's Laboratory for Advanced Visualization Applications (LAVA). Taking ICS 111 was my first step into programming as well as many others, Jason cultured every one of us in that class, whether we left or decided to stay.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
