“Olympic Runner” is a game I created in the ICS introduction class at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, this was my partner and I's final project in this class. Our task was to create a game that used a number of different functions that were taught throughout the course of the class. We came up with a version of "Simon Says" that got my professor laughing. The goal of the game is the same as the original, garner as many points as you can!

## Who is that man?

The man giving commands is none other than my ICS introduction level professor, Jason Leigh, the director of the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa's [Laboratory for Advanced Visualization Applications](http://lava.manoa.hawaii.edu) (LAVA). Taking ICS 111 was my first step into programming as well as many others, Jason cultured every one of us in that class, whether we left or decided to stay.
